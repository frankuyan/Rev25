##### General Prompting

`A popular way to format prompts is to write each input or output in a “name:content” style`
This would help us in getting more

Text Classification
- This would be important to get the model to classify the text into the right category. One of the *Biggest* issues
with most of the LLM model prompting.
- *label mapping* might be something to look more into. This is to map the output of the LLM to a potential response space.
- *label conditioning* is another important aspect to look into. This is to condition the output of the LLM to a specific label.


*Sentiment Analysis*
This should be somethign to look into as well. This can be a pretty common issue with LLMs.
Should be done in a catagorical manner, where each sentiment category is carefully defined and instructed.
